# Project/ App Title
Lagos State House Pricing Model

## Project description 
The proposed project, titled "Lagos State House Pricing Modle" seeks to address a pressing issue within the Lagos real estate market. This project is pivotal as it aims to provide an AI-driven solution for precisely predicting building prices. By doing so, it empowers buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals with data-driven insights to make informed decisions. The primary challenge at hand is the unpredictable nature of building prices in Lagos, Nigeria. The real estate market is subject to various factors, making it arduous for stakeholders to accurately estimate property values. As Ayodele and Olaleye (2022) emphasized, this complexity makes precise predictions a formidable task.

Currently, there is no comprehensive AI-based solution tailored for predicting building prices in Lagos. Traditional methods, including manual appraisal and historical data analysis, fall short in providing the accuracy and efficiency that AI can offer. Our proposed project represents an innovative approach to addressing this issue. Our project follows the established Data Science/Machine Learning (DS/ML) pipeline, including Data Sourcing, Data Cleaning and Preparation, ML Model Development, Model Evaluation, and Model Deployment.

1.	Data Sourcing:
•	Collected historical building price data from the Kaggle Housing Prices in Lagos, Nigeria dataset, which includes comprehensive information on location, size, features, and past sale prices (Kaggle Housing Prices in Lagos, Nigeria Dataset).
2.	Data Cleaning and Prep:
•	Carefully cleaned, formatted, and preprocessed the dataset to ensure its suitability for model training.
3.	ML Model Development:
•	Utilized a range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, and neural networks. The choice of these algorithms is based on their suitability for capturing the complex relationship between property features and market dynamics in Lagos.
4.	Model Evaluation:
•	Assessed the model's accuracy, reliability, and overall effectiveness using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.
5. Model Deployment:
