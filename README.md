[This readme should contain details about you team and project. Please Feel free to delete the text below if you forked this repository]

Now that you've formed your groups, it is essential to start brainstorming project ideas as this will be a fundamental part of your project proposal. We have created a team GitHub repository for your team. This is where your team is expected to carry out the projects and submit the [project proposal](project_proposal.md). Your project will involve building an end-to-end data science and machine learning solution in any area of your choosing. In case you're struggling to come up with an idea, you can find a [list of projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1et7o15BUiBCs06S5DiSzBBW1DmZ6a1pMoyevQE5yxbA/edit#gid=0) to support your decision (please note that these are simply ideas on what you can work on which you may or not choose to work on). You may also consider reviewing projects from [previous cohorts](https://github.com/AISaturdaysLagos/cohort7_projects), but keep in mind that if you choose a past project, you'll need to enhance the previous solution.

### Here is the timeline for your group projects:
- Group Communication Channels Creation Deadline: October 1, 2023
- Project Proposal Deadline: October 15, 2023
- Project Submission Deadline: December 10, 2023
